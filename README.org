* Twister
Is simple wrapper around mpv to play anime videos from twister.moe website. 

Twister.moe uses dynamic web loading so video source finding don't work with youtube-dl so I created this simple python script

* Requirements
- Python3 
- Pip (pipenv)
- Selenium installed though pip / pipenv
- Chromedriver or Geckodriver
  - If you installed Chromedriver you need chromium / chorme and if Geckodriver you need firefox
    
* Why tool like this
I prefer watch something sametime as I code and usually I have multi head setup but nowadays I use a lot my laptop with one monitor so browsers are quite screenspace heavy tools for single monitor.
